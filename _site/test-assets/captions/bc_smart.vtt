Hi.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm Bob Bailey, a Learning
Specialist with Brightcove.

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.840 align:middle line:90%
In this video, you'll
learn about Smart Players

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.180 align:middle line:90%
and how to easily publish videos
to desktop and mobile devices.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.870 align:middle line:90%
The consumption of video
content on mobile devices

7
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:90%
is expected to surpass
that of desktop devices

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.995 align:middle line:84%
in the next few years.

9
00:00:25.995 --> 00:00:28.120 align:middle line:90%
Every publisher wants to
make sure their videos can

10
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:84%
be accessed from mobile devices.

11
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Delivering video
on the mobile web

12
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:90%
is a challenging,
technical problem.

13
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Not all mobile devices
support the Flash player,

14
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.950 align:middle line:84%
such as the iPhone and iPad.

15
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Brightcove is working hard
to eliminate this complexity

16
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:90%
for our publishers to make
sure you can serve videos

17
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:90%
to your whole audience on both
desktop and mobile devices.

18
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Thanks to Brightcove
Smart Players,

19
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:90%
you can continue to publish
your video as you always have.

20
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:90%
With Smart Players,
your video will

21
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:90%
be delivered in Flash
or HTML5 depending

22
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:90%
on your viewer's
device capabilities.

23
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:90%
This enables you to use a
single Brightcove player that

24
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.777 align:middle line:90%
can deliver video
in Flash or HTML5,

25
00:01:09.777 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:90%
so you don't have
to create and manage

26
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:90%
separate players for
each viewer environment,

27
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:90%
and your existing
players can automatically

28
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:90%
load in Flash or HTML5 mode
without any custom work

29
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:90%
or additional
JavaScript on your part.

30
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:90%
In this demonstration, I've
created a simple player

31
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:90%
in Video Cloud
Studio and generated

32
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
the JavaScript publishing code.

33
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Notice when I view the player
on a desktop machine with Flash

34
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.540 align:middle line:90%
installed, I get the Flash-based
version of the player.

35
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:90%
When I view the video on an
iPad, I get the HTML5 player.

36
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Brightcove also offers
a Smart Player API,

37
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:90%
which allows you to create
custom solutions in JavaScript

38
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:90%
that work with both
Flash and HTML5 players.

39
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:90%
The Smart Player API exposes
objects, methods, events,

40
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:90%
and types for coding
additional functionality

41
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:90%
for your Video
Cloud Smart Players.

42
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:90%
